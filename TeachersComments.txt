1) Not a huge deal, but don't use .doc files in code. Txt is better, easier to read and so on.

2) Overall I like your ideas a lot.



Shopping List
Application that helps you make shopping list from a pre-defined list. Divided in categories and shops that carry that Item
Gui
	•	 Swing
 Business Logic
	•	Add a new item to the list, something you sometimes buy.
	•	Remove an item from the list, something you no longer ever buy.
	•	Move an item to a different slot. You might allow reordering by allowing the user to assign priority/category numbers, and you keep the list sorted by priority/category. Or you keep it sorted alphabetically.
	•	Check an item to put it on your list the next time you go shopping.
	•	Uncheck an item to remove it from your list the next time you go shopping.
	•	Print a list of just the checked items. You can take this to the store.
	•	Print a list of all items. You can use this to take a manual inventory of what you are out of.
	•	Save different Lists
	•	Send an email of your shopping list

 Persistence
	•	Data saved will be the different lists.
	•	Item List
	•	Category List
	•	Shop List
	•	And the different shopping Lists
	•	We will use a serialize object to save the data in a file

>>> .
	Perhaps you knew this and that is why you picked it, but Basic serialization is pretty straight forward.
	If  that is why you picked you where smart to do so. Java serialization is a good initial way to do persistence.
	However, I am little concerned that your  Persistence layer will be to light (easy). How about this.
	Get it working with serialization and for extra credit get it working XML too. All your interfaces should stay the
	same just the code that reads and writes the actual data should change. If you could pull this off, it would be great.


The text below is not that helpful.
It might help if you drew class diagrams. Do you know what they are? Basically boxes for each class with lines that show their
relationships. You can keep this very simple or use UML. If you don't know what UML is, don' worried about (universal modeling language).
However, I see that you have written some classes too (as I asked) this make it clearer.

Here are some comments.

Use packages for each layer of your program.

I gave you a outline for that.

after looking at your classes, I think you are basically on track, but your data access classes need to worked out a little better.
Try to use an metaphor that describes what you are trying to do in english and then map java classes to english nouns.
You are doing this OK with category and item, and shop, you just need to extend the metaphor to how you keep the records.
Perhaps, some thing as simple RecordKeeper that returns a list of your items, can search for specific items etc.

Let me know is my comments help or make it more confusing.
